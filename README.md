# GitHub is cringe

Let me tell you why:

1. **Closed source** - Even though GitHub is a forge for open source projects, the source code for GitHub itself is not.
1. **Owned by Microsoft** - I do not support how much of a monopoly Microsoft is, and thus I cannot support GitHub either.
1. **GitHub Copilot** - My private repositories are **not** your training data, Microsoft.

Using a closed-source and centralized system for hosting source code is not in the spirit of open-source.

I won't use this account more than I have to. Intead you can find me on [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~nomisiv)
